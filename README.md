# 📘 Student Record Manager (C++ CLI Application)

The **Student Record Manager** is a simple and beginner-friendly C++ console application that allows you to store, view, search, and delete student records.  
All data is saved in a local text file (`records.txt`), so your records remain even after closing the program.

This project demonstrates:
- File handling in C++  
- Working with structs and vectors  
- Parsing and writing formatted text  
- Building menu-based CLI applications
